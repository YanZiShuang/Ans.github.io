  <h2>Level 4 Unit 3</h2>
  <h3>Level4 Unit3 Part1</h3>
  <h4>Time Distribution</h4>
  <p>
    Loot at these two pie graphs.
  </p>
  <p>
    They show how these two people spend their days, not including weekends.
  </p>
  <p>
    The one on the top shows how Emma divides up her days.
  </p>
  <p>
    She is a designer who works for a large company.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Emma's graph shows, the biggest portion of her days is spent working.
  </p>
  <p>
    She works an average of 8 hours a day, which is one third of her day.
  </p>
  <p>
    She gets an average of 6 hours of sleep, which is 25% of her day.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's less sleep than Martin gets.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to his graph, he gets an average of 7 hours of sleep, which is about 29% of his day.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, Martin, who is an engineer, works more hours than Emma does.
  </p>
  <p>
    Martin averages 9 hours a day at work, compared to Emma's 8.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's 37.5% compared to 33%.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other factors shown in the graphs include time for meals and commuting to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other activities include getting dressed and household chores, such as doing laundry and paying bills.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, for Martin, commuting is taking a large amount of his time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If he could reduce his commute time, he would have more time for other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    And it isn't just the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the traffic is really heavy, his commute is stressful.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be great if he could work from home one or two days a week.
  </p>
  <p>
    his life would be more enjoyable.
  </p>
  <p>
    And looking at Emm's graph, we see that she probably needs more sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps she should spend a bit less time socializing with her friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, socializing with her friends is something she really values.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for putting on makeup, she isn't wiling to change that.
  </p>
  <p>
    For her, exercising, socializing and staying beautiful help her deal with the stress of work.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, Emma and Martin both wish that there were more hours in the day.
  </p>
  <h4>Job Satisfaction</h4>
  <p>
    This next graph shows how various factors compare in importance to 1350 job applicants.
  </p>
  <p>
    This applicants were between 20 and 25 years old.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were asked to list which factors were most important in a good job.  
  </p>
  <p>
    As the graph shows, money was the most important factor for 25 percent of the applicants.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, other factors were also important.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second most important factor was the work environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, for many, money isn't everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    People want to like where they work.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, if we combine Work Environment and Co-workers, the total is 35%.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is well above the 25% for salary and benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taken together, they are more important than salary and benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Career path is also important, especially for younger applicants.
  </p>
  <p>
    They want to see that their job helps build a successful career.
  </p>
  <p>
    For older workers, this may not be as important.
  </p>
  <p>
    Older workers often put a higher value on the balance between life and work.
  </p>
  <p>
    What do you think?
  </p>
  <p>
    The bese jobs satisfy several needs, not just salary and benefits.
  </p>
  <h4>Political Terms</h4>
  <p>
    The government of a country is its control system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Governments make laws and provide services to their citizens.
  </p>
  <p>
    The land over which a government has control is its territory.
  </p>
  <p>
    A country's territory has boundaries, or borders.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you leave or enter a country's territory you usually need a passport.
  </p>
  <p>
    A country's military provides defense for its territory and its citizens.
  </p>
  <p>
    The military includes an army, an air force, and a navy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main purpose of a military is to defend a country from attack.
  </p>
  <p>
    A country's criminal justice system includes the police, courts and prisons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its purpose is to enfore the law and protect people from criminal activities.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the citizens of a country live within its territory.
  </p>
  <p>
    The criminal justice system is responsible for enforcing the law.
  </p>
  <h4>Type of Government</h4>
  <p>
    A state of anarchy exists when a country has no effective government.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an anarchy, there is nobody to make decisions or enforce the laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    An autocracy is the simplest form of government.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an autocracy, the government is controlled by a single individual, known as the autocrat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether or not an autocracy is successful depends on the character and ability of the leader.

  </p>
  <p>
    The power of the government in a republic is limited by a constitution.
  </p>
  <p>
    A constitution is a written document that makes the rules for a government to follow.

  <p>
    This limits the power of the government.

  <h4>Story of Lang Lang 1</h4>
  <p>
    Lang Lang is one of the world's greatest concert pianists.
  </p>
  <p>
    His first contact with Western music was when he was just two years old.
  </p>
  <p>
    He watched a cartoon in which a cat played a famous piece by Franz Liszt.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this experience, he decided he wanted to learn to play the piano.
  </p>
  <p>
    When he was three and half years old, he started piano lessons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two years later he won first place in a piano competition.
  </p>
  <p>
    This early success gave his father high hopes that Lang Lang would become a great pianist.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Lang Lang was nine years old, his father quie his job and took him to Beijing.
  </p>
  <p>
    They lfet everything behind, including his mother who had to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lang Lang didn't want to leae her behind, but his father insisted.
  </p>
  <p>
    His father wanted him to study at the famous Central Conservatory of Music.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they moved to Beijing, they rented a flat in a poor area of the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this time, Lang Lang practiced for several hours a day.
  </p>
  <p>
    He stated practicing at 5 o'clock, which upset his neighbors.
  </p>
  <p>
    They would often pound on his door and ask him to stop practicing.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were so angry that he often feared that they would beat him up.
  </p>
  <h4> Story of Lang Lang 2  </h4>
  <p>
    Lang Lang usually had piano lessons once a week to prepare for the Conservatory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nearly 2000 students were applying for just 12 places at the Conservatory.
  </p>
  <p>
    His lessons were expensive and very difficult, especially because of his piano teacher.
  </p>
  <p>
    His music teacher didn't like Lang Lang.
  </p>
  <p>
    He called his teacher "Professor Angry" because she always gave him a hard time.
  </p>
  <p>
    His lessons were to prepare for entrance into the Conservatory.
  </p>
  <p>
    One afternoon, his teacher told him he had no talent and told him to go home.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon hearing the news, his father screamed and seemed to lose his mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    His father told him that everything was destroyed and there was no reason to live.
  </p>
  <p>
    He ordered Lang Lang to jump off the 11th-floor balcony.
  </p>
  <p>
    After this, Lang Lang almost went crazy.
  </p>
  <p>
    He didn't want to play the piano anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    For several months, he neither played the piano nor spoke to his father.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then some friends encouraged him to play a piece form them, and he realized his great love of the piano.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the next 19 months, he practiced hard and his father encouraged him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, when he was 10, he was accepted into the Conservatory with a full scholarship.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1995, when he was 13 years old, he played music by Chopin in the Beijing Concert Hall.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that same year he won first place in an international competition for young musicians in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
    When he was 15, he moved to the United States and began studies with a famous pianist at the Curtis Institure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then his career has grown and he has become a major star.
  </p>
  <p>
    One American music critic called him "the biggest, most exciting keyboard talent I have encountered in many a year of attending piano recitals."
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2010, Lang Lang signed a recording contract for several million dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2011, he performed at the White House for Presidents Obama of the United States and Hu jintao of China.
  </p>
  <p>
    When all of his success and fame, Lang Lang tries to encourage others.
  </p>
  <p>
    He uses his fame to spread the popularity of classical music and encourage young musicians.
  </p>
  <p>
    And in the end, Lang Lang and his father have rebuilt their relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    In his autobiography, Mr Lang dedicated the book to his mother and father.
